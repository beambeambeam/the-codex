You are provided with a document image and its dimensions.

The image may contain printed text, tables, figures, or other visual layout elements.

Your task:
- If OCR or any text is available (shown below), integrate it with your visual analysis to produce a rich, descriptive markdown explanation of the page content.
- If no text is present or the text is incomplete, rely entirely on visual cues (layout, fonts, graphics, spacing) to infer and describe the content naturally and comprehensively.

Formatting instructions:
- Use **markdown** syntax for structure: headings, lists, and tables.
- Format any tables using **markdown tables**.
- Insert `![Image](dummy.png)` placeholders where images or figures appear.

Length guidance:
- Your description should be roughly **{{ text_length }} words** but may vary slightly based on content complexity.

Output:
- Return your final output as a JSON object with a single key `natural_text` containing the markdown string.
