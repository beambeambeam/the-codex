You are provided with a document image and its dimensions.

The document may contain structured content such as tables, forms, diagrams, or headings.

Your task:
- Use any available raw text (below) combined with visual layout to reconstruct the document content.
- If no readable text is available, rely fully on visual elements and layout to describe the document.

Formatting instructions:
- Use **HTML tables** for tabular content.
- Use markdown for section titles, paragraphs, and overall structure.
- Insert `<figure>IMAGE_ANALYSIS</figure>` placeholders for visual diagrams or non-text elements.

Length guidance:
- Aim for about **{{ text_length }} words**, focusing on clear and accurate representation.

Output:
- Return a JSON object with one key, `natural_text`, containing the markdown description.
